### Objective

In this lab, I mimic real-world security risk assessment. Given the scenario of a toy company that needs to determine their control types and categories based on need and current security standards such as HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR.

### Skills Learned

- How to assess a security audit based on company assets.
- Being able to identify assets and existing policy to comply with best business standards.
- Ability to assess existing assets and complete/modify policies to increase security posture.
- Develop recommendations to increase security posture after identifying lack of or weaknesses.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- SOC1 & SOC2 documentation to better understand how they work and how to implement them.
- GDPR documentation to follow through with accurate information on why it is necessary.
- PCI DSS documentation to understand the importance of keeping payment infomration safe.

  [Toy Company Pre-Assessment description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nYYsL-C8z9wYYmwGqse-O0DKusC61a76/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs)
- Second, understand the types of controls as well as the categories.
  [Types and Categories of Controls](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14kKVzsjs_HXAF7XRx3d73LjEWhqekV-_/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs)
- Third is to create the checklist, and follow up as a report checking to see what fits depending on the category and control as per the companies existing policies and controls.
- Fourth is to draft a recomendation such as adjust firewall rules, or introduce an IDS.
